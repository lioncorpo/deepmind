// Server provides an RPC server with method handlers which can be defined at
// runtime. Method handlers are registered with a name and can have arbitrary
// signatures. On the wire, arguments and return values are serialized with
// the proto schema defined in serialization.proto. The thread pool size
// determines how many method handlers can be executed concurrently.
//
// This class can either be used in its own right or from Python via Pybind11
// bindings (see courier/python/server.cc). The Pybind11 API defines
// the semantics of the server lifetime operations (Start, Stop, Join)
// and the method handler operations (Bind, Unbin, ListMethods, Call).
// For implementation details on the latter see courier_service.h.
//
// Summary: all operations are thread-safe, Start and Stop must only be called
// once, and Bind/Unbind serializes with Call. For best performance, don't call
// Bind/Unbind in the hot path. Uninterrupted concurrent calls to Call do not
// block one another.
